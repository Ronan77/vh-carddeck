import Deck

// Simple UNO Rules:
// 1. 52 cards
// 2. No special cards (no plus cards, no reverse, no wild cards, no change color, etc).
// 3. 2 players
// 4. No user input (yet)
// 5. 7 cards per hand
// 6. Goal: to have 0 cards
// 7. Turn consists of:
//    a. Match suit or rank of card to top card on pile
//    b. If match (see a.) then discard one matching card
//    c. If no match, draw a card until you have a match (see a.)
// 8. If there are no card in the discard pile, then put one here face up from the draw pile
// 9. "UNO" does not need to be called
